The OSVVM Simulator Script Library
##################################

The OSVVM Simulator Script Library provides a simple way to create and
activate libraries, compile designs, and run simulations.

The intent of this scripting approach is to:

-  Run the same scripts on any simulator
-  Be as easy to read as a compile order list.
-  Know the directory the script is in, the script only manages relative 
   paths to itself.  No Awkward path management in the scripts.
-  Simplify integration of other libraries

This is an evolving approach. So it may change in the future. Input is
welcome.

Start by Running the Demo
==================================

Download OSVVM Libraries 
-----------------------------------

OSVVM is available as either a git repository 
`OSVVM Libraries <https://github.com/osvvm/OsvvmLibraries>`__ 
or a zip file from `osvvm.org Downloads Page <https://osvvm.org/downloads>`__.

On GitHub, all OSVVM libraries are a submodule of the repository OsvvmLibraries. Download all OSVVM libraries using git clone with the “–recursive” flag:

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/osvvm/OsvvmLibraries

Create a Sim directory
----------------------

Create a simulation directory. Generally I name this "sim" or
"sim_vendor-name". Creating a simulation directory means that
cleanup before running regressions is just a matter of deleting the sim
directory and recreating a new one.

The following assumes you have created a directory named "sim" in the
OsvvmLibraries directory.

Alternately, you can run simulations out of the Scripts, but cleanup is
a mess as a simulator tends to create numerous temporaries.


Start the Script environment in the Simulator
--------------------------------------------------------

Do the actions appropriate for your simulator.

Aldec RivieraPRO, Siemens QuestaSim and ModelSim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the OSVVM Script environment by doing:

.. code:: tcl

   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartUp.tcl

Want to avoid doing this every time? In Aldec RivieraPro, set the
environment variable, ALDEC_STARTUPTCL to StartUp.tcl (including the
path information). Similarly in Mentor QuestaSim/ModelSim, set the
environment variable, MODELSIM_TCL to StartUp.tcl (including the path
information).

Aldec ActiveHDL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the OSVVM Script environment by doing:

.. code:: tcl

   scripterconf -tcl
   do -tcl <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartUp.tcl

Want to avoid doing this every time? For ActiveHDL, edit
/script/startup.do and add above to it. Similarly for VSimSA, edit
/BIN/startup.do and add the above to it. Note, with 2021.02, you no
longer need to set the "Start In" directory to the OSVVM Scripts
directory.

GHDL in Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the OSVVM Script environment by doing:

.. code:: tcl

   winpty tclsh
   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartUp.tcl
   
To simplify this, put ``source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartUp.tcl`` 
in the ``.tclshrc`` file and add a windows short cut that does 
``C:\tools\msys64\mingw64.exe winpty tclsh``. 

GHDL in Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the OSVVM Script environment by doing:

.. code:: tcl

   rlwrap tclsh
   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartUp.tcl

To simplify this, put ``source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartUp.tcl`` 
in the ``.tclshrc`` file and in bash add ``alias gsim='rlwrap tclsh'`` to your ``.bashrc``.

NVC in Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the OSVVM Script environment by doing:

.. code:: tcl

   winpty tclsh
   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartNVC.tcl
   
To simplify this, put ``source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartNVC.tcl`` 
in the ``.tclshrc`` file and add a windows short cut that does 
``C:\tools\msys64\mingw64.exe winpty tclsh``.

NVC in Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the OSVVM Script environment by doing:

.. code:: tcl

   rlwrap tclsh
   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartNVC.tcl

To simplify this, put ``source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartNVC.tcl`` 
in the ``.tclshrc`` file and in bash add ``alias nsim='rlwrap tclsh'`` to your ``.bashrc``.

Synopsys VCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the OSVVM Script environment by doing:

.. code:: tcl

   rlwrap tclsh
   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartVCS.tcl

To simplify this, put ``source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartVCS.tcl`` 
in the ``.tclshrc`` file.
In bash, add ``alias ssim='rlwrap tclsh'`` to your ``.bashrc``.


Cadence Xcelium
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the OSVVM Script environment by doing:

.. code:: tcl

   rlwrap tclsh
   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartXcelium.tcl

To simplify this, add the following line to the ``.tclshrc`` file.

.. code:: tcl

   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartXcelium.tcl
 
In bash, add ``alias ssim='rlwrap tclsh'`` to your ``.bashrc``.

Xilinx XSIM
~~~~~~~~~~~

Using OSVVM in Xilinx XSIM is under development.  So far, Xilinx seems 
to be able to compile OSVVM utility library, however, we have not had
any of our internal test cases pass.  

To run OSVVM scripts in XSIM, start Vivado and then run the StartXSIM
script shown below:

.. code:: tcl

   source <path-to-OsvvmLibraries>/OsvvmLibraries/Scripts/StartXSIM.tcl

If someone from XILINX is interested, the internal OSVVM utility library
testbenches can be provided under an NDA.

Run the Demos
--------------

Do the following in your simulator command line:  

.. code-block::

  build  ../OsvvmLibraries
  build  ../OsvvmLibraries/RunDemoTests.pro
  
These will produce some reports, such as OsvvmLibraries_RunDemoTests.html.
We will discuss these in the next section, OSVVM Reports.


Writing Scripts by Example
==================================

OSVVM Scripts are an API layer that is build on top of TCL.
The API layer simplifies the steps of running simulations.
For most applications you will not need any TCL, however,
it is there if you need more capability.

Basic Script Commands
--------------------------
- library <library-name>
   - Make this library the active library. Create it if it does not exist. 
- analyze <VHDL-file>
   - Compile (aka analyze) the design into the active library.
- simulate <test-name>
   - Simulate (aka elaborate + run) the design using the active library.
- include <script-name>.pro
   - Include another project script
- build <script-name>.pro
   - Start a script from the simulator.  It is include + start a new log file for this script.
   
Scripts are named in the form ``<script-name>.pro``.  
The scripts are TCL that is agumented with the OSVVM script API.
The script API is created using TCL procedures.  

For more details, see Command Summary later in this document.

Running a Simple Test
--------------------------
At the heart of running a simulation is setting the library, 
compiling files, and starting the simulation. 
To do this, we use library, analyze, and simulate. 

The following is an excerpt from the scripts used to 
run OSVVM verification component library regressions.

.. code:: tcl

   library  osvvm_TbAxi4_MultipleMemory
   analyze  TestCtrl_e.vhd
   analyze  TbAxi4_MultipleMemory.vhd
   analyze  TbAxi4_Shared1.vhd
   TestCase TbAxi4_Shared1
   simulate TbAxi4_Shared1

In OSVVM scripting, calling library activates the library. 
An analyze or simulate that follows library uses the specified library. 
This is consistent with VHDL’s sense of the "working library".

Note that there are no paths to the files.
For OSVVM commands that use paths, the path is
always relative to the directory the script is located in
unless an absolute path is specified.

The above script is in the file, testbench_MultipleMemory.pro.
It can be run by specifying:

.. code:: tcl

   build ../OsvvmLibraries/AXI4/Axi4/testbench_MultipleMemory/testbench_MultipleMemory.pro

If you were to open testbench_MultipleMemory.pro, you would find
that RunTest is used instead as it is an abbreviation for the
analyze, TestCase and simulate when the names are the same.

Simulating with Generics
--------------------------
To specify generics, use the OSVVM generic function. 
Generic is called in the call to simulate as shown below.
Note the square brackets are required and tell TCL to call 
the function to create the arguments for simulate.  
Calling generic this way allows OSVVM to do set generics using
the method required by each simulator.  

.. code:: tcl

   library  default
   simulate Tb [generic WIDTH 8]
   simulate Tb [generic G1 5] [generic G2 7]
   
Release 2022.09 removed the necessity to put quotes around the options specified with simulate.

Debugging and Logging Signal Values (for later display)
--------------------------------------------------------
By default, OSVVM scripting focuses on running regressions fast. 
Adding debugging information, logging signals, and/or displaying waveforms will slow things down. 
In addition, by default, if one simulation crashes, the scripts will continue and run the next simulation.

To add debugging information to your simulation, call SetDebugMode. 
If you do not call SetDebugMode, the debug mode is false. 
If you call SetDebugMode without a true or false value, the default is true.

.. code:: tcl

   SetDebugMode true

To log signals so they can be displayed after the simulation finishes, call SetLogSignals. 
If you do not call SetLogSignals, the log signals mode is false. 
If you call SetLogSignals without a true or false value, the default is true.

.. code:: tcl

   SetLogSignals true

Whether analyze or simulate stop on a failure or not is controlled by the internal variables AnalyzeErrorStopCount and SimulateErrorStopCount. 
By default, these values are set to 0, which means do not stop.  
Setting them to a non-zero value, causes either analyze or simulate to stop when the specified number of errors occur.  
Hence, to stop after one error, set them as follows. 

 .. code:: tcl

   set ::osvvm::AnalyzeErrorStopCount  1
   set ::osvvm::SimulateErrorStopCount  1

To do all of the above in one step, call SetInteractiveMode. 
If you call SetInteractiveMode without a true or false value, the default is true.

If you do not like the OSVVM default settings, you can add any of these to your LocalScriptDefaults.tcl.   

Also note that there are scripts that automatically run when you call a simulation (see next section).
You can use these scripts to display waveforms.

Scripts that Run during Simulate if they exist
----------------------------------------------------
Often with simulations, we want to add a custom waveform file. 
This may be for all designs or just one particular design.
We may also need specific actions to be done when running
on a particular simulator.

When simulate (or RunTest) is called, it will source the following files in order, if they exist:

-  <ToolVendor>.tcl
-  <ToolName>.tcl
-  wave.do 
-  <LibraryUnit>.tcl
-  <LibraryUnit>_<ToolName>.tcl
-  <TestCaseName>.tcl
-  <TestCaseName>_<ToolName>.tcl

Note that wave.do will not run if you are running in a batch environment (such as vsim -c in QuestaSim).
ToolVendor is either {Aldec, Siemens, Cadence, Synopsys}. 
ToolName is one of {QuestaSim, ModelSim, RivieraPRO, ActiveHDL, VCS, Xcelium}. 
LibraryUnit is the name specified to simulate. 
TestCaseName is the name specified to TestCase.

It will search for these files in the following directories
- OsvvmLibraries/Scripts
- CurrentSimulationDirectory
- CurrentWorkingDirectory

CurrentSimulationDirectory is the directory in which the simulator is running.
CurrentWorkingDirectory is the directory of the script that calls either 
RunTest or simulate.   

Currently NVC and GHDL do not run any extra scripts since they are batch
simulators.

Adding Other Wave Files
--------------------------
To include wave files with names different from above, use the DoWaves function. 
DoWaves is called in the call to simulate as shown below. 
Note the square brackets are required and tell TCL to call 
the function to create the arguments for simulate.  

If the wave1.do file is not in CurrentSimulationDirectory, then it will need path information.
In Aldec and Siemens, these are run via the simulator command line (via -do). 
The method of running them may change in the future (and may use source).

.. code:: tcl

   library  default
   simulate Tb [DoWaves wave1.do]
   simulate Tb [DoWaves wave1.do wave2.do] 

Saving Waveforms With GHDL and NVC
----------------------------------------------------
The open source simulators GHDL and NVC run in a batch mode, but can save waveforms to see with a separate viewer (Gtkwave).   
To save waveforms for GHDL and NVC, call SetSaveWaves. 
If you do not call SetSaveWaves, the debug mode is false. 
If you call SetSaveWaves without a true or false value, the default is true.

.. code:: tcl

   SetSaveWaves true

Including Scripts
--------------------------
We build our designs hierarchically.
Therefore our scripts need to be build hierarchically.
When one script calls another script, such as OsvvmLibraries.pro does, we use include.
The code for OsvvmLibraries.pro is as follows. 
The ``if`` is TCL and is only building the UART, AXI4, and DpRam if 
their corresponding directories exist.

.. code:: tcl

   include ./osvvm/osvvm.pro
   include ./Common/Common.pro
 
   if {[DirectoryExists UART]} { 
     include ./UART/UART.pro
   }
   if {[DirectoryExists AXI4]} { 
     include ./AXI4/AXI4.pro
   }
   if {[DirectoryExists DpRam]} { 
     include ./DpRam/DpRam.pro
   }

Note the paths specified to include are relative to OsvvmLibriaries 
directory since that is where OsvvmLibraries.pro is located.

Building the OSVVM Libraries
-------------------------------------------
Build is a layer on top of include (it calls include) that creates a logging point.
In general, build is called from the simulator API (when we run something) 
and include is called from scripts.
 
By default, OSVVM creates collects all tool output for a build into 
an html based log file in ./logs/<tool_name>-<version>/<script-name>.html.

To compile all of the OSVVM libraries, use build as shown below. 

.. code:: tcl

   build ../OsvvmLibraries/OsvvmLibraries.pro

Running OSVVM Test Cases
--------------------------------
All OSVVM verification components are delivered with their
regression test suite. 
There is also a script, named RunAllTests.pro, that runs
all of the tests for that specific VC.

To run the AXI4 Full verification component regression suite, 
use the build shown below. 

.. code:: tcl

   build ../OsvvmLibraries/AXI4/Axi4/RunAllTests.pro

Everything in OSVVM is composed hierarchically. 
If you want to run all AXI4 (Axi4 Full, Axi4Lite, and AxiStream),
use the build shown below.

.. code:: tcl

   build ../OsvvmLibraries/AXI4/RunAllTests.pro

Similarly to run the tests for all VC in OsvvmLibraries use the build
shown below.  

.. code:: tcl

   build ../OsvvmLibraries/RunAllTests.pro
   

For most VC and OsvvmLibraries, there is a RunDemoTests.pro that runs
a small selection of the VC test cases.

Do not use TCL's source or EDA tool's do
--------------------------------------------------
OSVVM uses include since it helps manage the path of where the
script files are located.
Include uses TCL's ``source`` internally.
However, if you use TCL's ``source`` (or EDA tool's ``do``) instead, 
you will not get include's directory management features and
your scripts will need to manage the directory paths themselves.

Do not use TCL's cd
--------------------------------------------------
Simulators create files containing library mappings and
other information in the simulation directory.
If you use ``cd`` you lose all of this information.
OSVVM tracks the simulation directory in the
variable ::osvvm::CurrentSimulationDirectory.

OSVVM tracks the directory in which scripts run as
CurrentWorkingDirectory.   All OSVVM API commands
run relative to CurrentWorkingDirectory. 
When you call a script in another directory using include, 
CurrentWorkingDirectory is automatically updated
to be the directory that contains the script.   
When include finishes it restores CurrentWorkingDirectory
to be its value before include was called.

If while running a script, you need to adjust the
CurrentWorkingDirectory, use ChangeWorkingDirectory.
Like cd, ChangeWorkingDirectory allows either 
relative or absolute paths.  

.. code:: tcl

   ChangeWorkingDirectory src
   analyze Axi4Manager.vhd
   
If you need to determine a path relative to the
CurrentWorkingDirectory, use ``JoinWorkingDirectory``.
In the following, the relative path used by LinkLibraryDirectory
is 

.. code:: tcl

   LinkLibraryDirectory [JoinWorkingDirectory RelativePath]


OSVVM's Reports
==================================
Good reports simplify debug and help find problems quickly. 
This is important as according to the 
`2020 Wilson Verification Survey FPGA  <https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/verificationhorizons/2020/12/02/part-4-the-2020-wilson-research-group-functional-verification-study/>`__
verification engineers spend 46% of their time debugging.

OSVVM produces the following reports:   

- HTML Build Summary Report for human inspection that provides test completion status.  
- JUnit XML Build Summary Report for use with continuous integration (CI/CD) tools.   
- HTML Test Case Detailed report for each test case with Alert, Functional Coverage, and Scoreboard reports.  
- HTML based simulator transcript/log files (simulator output)  
- Text based test case transcript file (from TranscriptOpen)  

The best way to see the reports is to look at the ones from the demo. 
If you have not already done ``build OsvvmLibraries/RunDemoTests.pro``, 
then do so now.

HTML Build Summary Report
-------------------------------------------
The Build Summary Report allows us to quickly confirm if a 
build passed or quickly identify which test cases did not PASS. 

The Build Summary Report has three distinct pieces:   

- Build Status   
- Test Suite Summary   
- Test Case Summary   

For each Test Suite and Test Case, there is additional information,
such as Functional Coverage and Disabled Alert Count.

In the sim directory, the Build Summary Report is 
in the file OsvvmLibraries_RunDemoTests.html.

Note that any place in the report there is a triangle preceding text,
pressing on the triangle will rotate it and either hide or reveal
additional information.


Build Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Build Status, shown below, is in a table at the top of the 
Build Summary Report. 
If code coverage is run, there will be a link to 
the results at the bottom of the Build Summary Report.

Test Suite Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When running tests, test cases are grouped into test suites.
A build can include multiple test suites.
The next table we see in the Build Summary Report is the
Test Suite Summary.  
The figure below shows 
that this build includes the test suites Axi4Full, AxiStream, and UART.

Test Case Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The remainder of the Build Summary Report is Test Case Summary, see below.
There is a seprate Test Case Summary for each test suite in the build.

.. figure:: images/DemoTestCaseSummaries.png
  :name: TestCaseSummaryFig
  :scale: 50 %
  :align: center
  
  Test Case Summary

 
JUnit XML Build Summary Report
-------------------------------------------
The JUnit XML Build Summary Report works with 
continuous integration (CI/CD).   
The CI/CD tools use this to understand if the test
is passing or not.
They also have facilities for displaying the 
report - however, the OSVVM HTML format provides
a superset of information.

OSVVM runs regressions on GitHub.  

HTML Test Case Detailed Report
------------------------------------------
For each test case that is run (simulated), 
a Test Case Detailed Report is produced that
contains consists of the following information:  

- Test Information Link Table  
- Alert Report  
- Functional Coverage Report(s)  
- Scoreboard Report(s)  
- Link to Test Case Transcript (opened with Transcript Open)   
- Link to this test case in HTML based simulator transcript  

After running one of the regressions, open one of the HTML files 
in the directory ./reports/<test-suite-name>.  An example one is shown below.

.. figure:: images/DemoTestCaseDetailedReport.png

  Test Case Detailed Report


Note that any place in the report there is a triangle preceding text,
pressing on the triangle will rotate it and either hide or reveal
additional information.


Test Information Link Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Test Information Link Table is in a table at the top of the 
Test Case Detailed Report. 
The figure below has links to the Alert Report (in this file),
Functional Coverage Report (in this file),
Scoreboard Reports (in this file),
a link to simulation results (if the simulation report is in HTML),
and a link to any transcript files opened by OSVVM.

Alert Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Alert Report, shown below, provides detailed information for each AlertLogID
that is used in a test case.  Note that in the case of expected errors, the errors
still show up as FAILED in the Alert Report and are rectified in the total error count.

.. figure:: images/DemoAlertReport.png

Functional Coverage Report(s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Test Case Detailed Report contains a 
Functional Coverage Report, shown below, for each 
functional coverage model used in the test case.
Note this report is not from the demo.

Test Case Transcript
-------------------------------------------
OSVVM's transcript utility facilitates collecting all 
test output to into a single file, as shown below.  

.. figure:: images/DemoVHDLTranscript.png

  :align: center
  
  Test Case Transcript



HTML Simulator Transcript
-------------------------------------------
Simulator transcript files can be long.  
The basic OSVVM regression test (OsvvmLibraries/RunAllTests.pro),
produces a log file that is 84K lines long.  
As a plain text file, this is not browsable, however,
when converted to an html file it is.
OSVVM gives you the option to create either html (default), shown below, or plain text.
In the html report, any place there is a triangle preceding text,
pressing on the triangle will rotate it and either hide or reveal
additional information.

How To Generate Reports
==================================

VHDL Aspects of Generating Reports
------------------------------------------  
To generate reports, you need to have the following in your VHDL testbench:  

* Name your test case with ``SetTestName("TestName")``.  
* Do some self-checking with ``AffirmIf``, ``AffirmIfEqual``, or ``AffirmIfNotDiff``.  
* End the test case with ``EndOfTestReports``.  

These following code snippet shows these in use.
More details of this are in `OSVVM Test Writers User Guide <https://github.com/OSVVM/Documentation/blob/main/OSVVM_test_writers_user_guide.pdf>`__ in the documentation repository.

.. code:: vhdl

   -- Reference to OSVVM Utility Library
   library OSVVM ;
   context OSVVM.OsvvmContext ;
   . . . 
   TestProc : process
   begin
     -- Name the Test
     SetTestName("TbDut") ; 
     . . .
     -- Do some Checks
     AffirmIfEqual(Data, X"A025", "Check Data") ;
     . . . 
     -- Generate Reports (replaces call to ReportAlerts)
     EndOfTestReports ; 
     std.env.stop(GetAlertCount) ; 
   end process TestProc ; 

Generating Reports and Simple Tests
------------------------------------------  
If we have a simple test, where the design name is 
Dut.vhd and the testbench is TbDut.vhd,
then we can run it with the following script

.. code:: tcl

   # File name:  Dut.pro
   analyze   Dut.vhd
   analyze   TbDut.vhd
   simulate  TbDut
   
If we run this test with using ``build Dut.pro``, 
Dut and TbDut will be compiled into the library named default. 
The simulation TbDut will run and 
a build summary report will be created with only one test case in it.
The test suite will be named Default. 
The test case will be named TbDut.  
Be sure to name the test internally to TbDut using SetTestName
as otherwise, a NAME_MISMATCH failure will be generated.


Generating Reports and Running Tests without Configurations
------------------------------------------------------------------  
In OSVVM, we use the testbench framework shown in the
`OSVVM Test Writers User Guide <https://github.com/OSVVM/Documentation/blob/main/OSVVM_test_writers_user_guide.pdf>`__ (see documentation repository). 
The test harness in the following example is named TbUart. 
The test sequencer entity is in file TestCtrl_e.vhd. 
Tests are in architectures of TestCtrl in the files,
TestCtrl_SendGet1.vhd, TestCtrl_SendGet2.vhd, and TbtCtrl_Scoreboard1.vhd. 
The tests are run by calling "simulate TbUart".
TestCase is used to specify the test name that is running.
This is needed here as otherwise the name TbUart would be used.
The test case that is run is the latest one that was analyzed.


.. code:: tcl

   TestSuite Uart
   library   osvvm_TbUart
   analyze   TestCtrl_e.vhd
   analyze   TbUart.vhd

   TestCase  TbUart_SendGet1
   analyze   TestCtrl_SendGet1.vhd 
   simulate  TbUart

   TestCase  TbUart_SendGet2
   analyze   TestCtrl_SendGet2.vhd 
   simulate  TbUart

   TestCase  TbUart_Scoreboard1
   analyze   TestCtrl_Scoreboard1.vhd 
   simulate  TbUart
   
The above call to TestCase puts the TestCase name into the build
test summary YAML file.   
If the simulation for any reason fails to run, there will be 
no test status information in the YAML file.
As a result, when the build summary report is being created,
it will detect this as a test failure.

Another possibility in the above test scenario is that a 
particular test case fails to analyze.   
In this case, if the script continues and calls simulate,
the previously successfully compiled test will run.
In this case, if each test is given a unique name in VHDL
using SetTestName (which is also recorded in the YAML file),
then the VHDL test name will not match the test case name
and a NAME_MISMATCH failure will be generated by the scripts.  

Generating Reports and Running Tests with Configurations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The OSVVM verification component regression suite uses configurations 
to specify an exact architecture to run in a given test.
We give the configuration, the test case, and the file the same name.
We also put the configuration declaration at the end of the file
containing the test case (try it, you will understand why).  
When we run a test that uses a configuration, simulate specifies 
the configuration's design unit name.
Hence, we revise the sequence of running one test to be as follows.

.. code:: tcl

   TestCase  TbUart_SendGet1
   analyze   TbUart_SendGet1.vhd 
   simulate  TbUart_SendGet1

When running a large test suite, this gets tedious, so we added 
a shortcut named RunTest that encapsulates the above three
steps into the single step.  
This changes our original script to the following. 
If the name in RunTest has a path, the path is only used with analyze.

.. code:: tcl

   TestSuite Uart
   library   osvvm_TbUart
   analyze   TestCtrl_e.vhd
   analyze   TbUart.vhd

   RunTest   TbUart_SendGet1.vhd 
   RunTest   TbUart_SendGet2.vhd 
   RunTest   TbUart_Scoreboard1.vhd 

One advantage of using configurations is that 
on a clean build (library deleted before starting it), 
if a test case fails to analyze, then the 
corresponding configuration will fail to analyze, 
and the simulation will fail to run.
If this happens, it will be detected and recorded
as a test failure in the build summary report.

Turning on Code Coverage 
==================================
Code coverage is a metric that tells us if certain parts of our design
have been exercised or not.  Turning on code coverage with OSVVM is simple.
In the following example, we enable coverage options during analysis and 
simulation separately.   

.. code:: tcl

   # File name:  Dut.pro
   SetCoverageAnalyzeEnable true
   analyze   Dut.vhd
   SetCoverageAnalyzeEnable false
   SetCoverageSimulateEnable true
   analyze   TbDut.vhd
   simulate  TbDut
   SetCoverageSimulateEnable false
   
Note that CoverageAnalyzeEnable is specifically turned off
before compiling the testbench so that the testbench is not 
included in the coverage metrics.

You can also set specific options by using SetCoverageAnalyzeOptions 
and SetCoverageSimulateOptions.  By default, OSVVM sets these options
so that statement, branch, and statemachine coverage is collected. 

When coverage is turned on for a build, coverage is collected for each test.  
If there are multiple test suites in the build,
when a test suite completes execution, 
the coverage for each test in the test suite is merged.  
When a build completes the coverage from each test suite 
is merged and an html coverage report is produced.

Caution any undocumented commands are experimental and may change or be removed in a future revision.


Variables
==================================

Variables set by OSVVM Scripts
------------------------------------------ 
All osvvm VendorScripts_xxx.tcl set the variables
ToolVendor, ToolName, ToolType, and ToolNameVersion. 
These are useful for personalizing scripts. 
For example, 

.. code:: tcl

   if {$ToolName eq "GHDL"} {
     # ... do something based on GHDL
   } 

ToolVendor is the name of the vendor.
ToolName is the name of the tool.  
ToolType can be either "simulator" or "synthesis".
ToolNameVersion is formatted "<ToolName-version>", 
where version is specific to a tool and revision.

Note that ToolName was formerly named simulator.
The variable simulator is deprecated.  
Use ToolName instead.  

The settings for ToolVendor and ToolName is as defined
in the table below.

.. list-table:: 
    :widths: 10 10 10 30
    :header-rows: 1
    
    * - ToolVendor
      - ToolName
      - ToolType
      - Notes
    * - Aldec
      - ActiveHDL
      - simulator
      -

    * - NVC
      - NVC

    * - Siemens
      - ModelSim
      - simulator
      -
    * - Siemens

      - simulator
      -
    * - Synopsys
      - VCS
      - simulator
      -
    * - Xilinx
      - XSIM
      - simulator
      - Still in Debug
    * - Xilinx
      - Vivado
      - synthesis
      - Currently supports analyze
      

These variables can be used to do tool specific actions in scripts.   I use the following in my LocalScriptDefaults.tcl (see next section) file.   

.. code:: tcl

   if {$::osvvm::ToolVendor eq "Siemens"} {
       SetExtendedAnalyzeOptions  "-quiet"
       SetExtendedSimulateOptions "-quiet"
   } 


Variables used to configure OSVVM
------------------------------------------ 
OSVVM sets variables in the file OsvvmDefaultSettings.tcl.
Do not change this file.   Instead, create a LocalScriptsDefaults.tcl.
An easy way to do this is to copy Example_LocalScriptDefaults.tcl
to LocalScriptDefaults.tcl.  LocalScriptDefaults.tcl is not
in the OSVVM release - which allows you to modify it and 
not have it overwritten when you update your release.

Complete documentation for each variable is in the 
Example_LocalScriptDefaults.tcl file.    

Using LocalSdriptDefaults, you can change things such as
   - OSVVM created directories with reports, results, and libraries.
   - TCL Error signaling
   - Generate html transcript
   - Generate a single tcl script for everything run

Note that some of the OSVVM commands are can also be 
set using variables.

Generating Reports when a Simulation or Build Ends in Error
====================================================================
If a simulation crashed and there are no test case reports, they can be created
by calling Simulate2Html as follows.  

.. code:: tcl

   Simulate2Html <TestCaseName> <TestSuiteName> <TestCaseFileName>
   
If no generics are set, then TestCaseFileName is the same as TestCaseName.  
If generics are set, TestCaseFileName is TestCaseName_GenericName_Value.

If the build failed, use Report2Html to create the build summary report
from the YAML file and use Log2Osvvm to create the HTML log file from 
the text base log file.

.. code:: tcl

		Report2Html <YamlFileName>
 		Log2Osvvm  <LogFileName>

Note on Scripts for Siemens
==================================

During simulation OSVVM suppresses QuestaSim/ModelSim messages 8683 and 8684.
These are warnings about potential issues with port drivers due to QuestaSim/ModelSim 
using non-VHDL compliant optimizations.  The potential issues these warn about 
do not occur with OSVVM interfaces.   As a result, these warnings are suppressed 
because they consume significant time at the startup of simulations. 
 
You can learn more about these messages by doing “verror 8683” or “verror 8684” 
from within the tool GUI.   

verror 8683
------------------------------------------ 

An output port has no default expression in its declaration and has no drivers.  
The VHDL LRM-compliant value it propagates to higher-level connected signals may 
not be what is desired.  In particular, this behavior might not correspond to 
the synthesis view of initialization.  The vsim switch "-defaultstdlogicinittoz" 
or "-forcestdlogicinittoz"may be useful in this situation.

OSVVM Analysis of Message # 8683
------------------------------------------ 

OSVVM interfaces that is used to connect VC to the test sequencer (TestCtrl) use 
minimum as a resolution function.  Driving the default value (type'left) on a 
signal has no negative impact.  Hence, OSVVM disables this warning since it does 
not apply.

verror 8684
------------------------------------------ 

An output port having no drivers has been combined with a higher-level connected 
signal.  The port will get its initial value from this higher-level connected 
signal; this is not compliant with the behavior required by the VHDL LRM.  

LRM compliant behavior would require the port's initial value come from its 
declaration, however, since it was combined or collapsed with the port or signal 
higher in the hierarchy, the initial value came from that port or signal.

LRM compliant behavior can be obtained by preventing the collapsing of these ports 
with the vsim switch -donotcollapsepartiallydriven. If the port is collapsed to a 
port or signal with the same initialization (as is often the case of default 
initializations being applied), there is no problem and the proper initialization 
is done and the simulation is LRM compliant.

OSVVM Analysis of Message # 8684
------------------------------------------ 

Older OSVVM VC use records whose elements are std_logic_vector.   These VC 
initialize port values to 'Z'.  QuestaSim non-VHDL compliant optimizations, such as 
port collapsing, remove these values.  If you are using older OSVVM verification 
components, you can avoid any impact of this non compliant behavior if you initialize 
the transaction interface signal in the test harness to all 'Z'.  
 
Hence, OSVVM disables this warning since it does not apply if you use the due 
care recommended above.

OSVVM recommends that you migrate older interfaces to the newer that uses types 
and resolution functions defined in ResolutionPkg such as std_logic_max, 
std_logic_vector_max, or std_logic_vector_max_c rather than std_logic or 
std_logic_vector.   ResolutionPkg supports a richer set of types, such as 
integer_max, real_max, ...


Deprecated Descriptor Files
==================================
Include with a file extension of ".dirs" or ".files" is deprecated and
is only supported for backward compatibility.

<Name>.dirs is a directory descriptor file that contains a list of
directories. Each directory is handled by calling "include <directory>".

<Name>.files is a file descriptor that contains a list of names. Each
name is handled by calling "analyze <name>". If the extension of the
name is ".vhd" or ".vhdl" the file will be compiled as VHDL source. If
the extension of the name is ".v" the file will be compiled as verilog
source. If the extension of the name is ".lib", it is handled by calling
"library <name>".
