#  Description
#    Tcl procedures to configure and adapt the OSVVM simulator 
#    scripting methodology for a particular project.
#    As part of its tasks, it runs OSVVM scripts that define
#    procedures use in the OSVVM scripting methodology.

#  Revision History:
#    Date      Version    Description
#    05/2022   2022.05    Refactored StartUp.tcl to move items 
#                         shared by all StartUp scripts to StartUpShared.tcl
#    01/2022   2022.01    New StartUp algorithm for detecting ActiveHDL's VSimSA.
#    10/2021   2021.10    Loads YAML utilities when YAML library available: OsvvmYamlSupport.tcl, NoYamlPackage.tcl
#                         Loads LocalScriptDefaults.tcl if it is in the OsvvmScriptDirectory.  This is a optional user settings file.
#                         LocalScriptsDefaults.tcl is not provided by OSVVM so your local settings will not be overwritten.  
#     2/2021   2021.02    Refactored.                                                          
#                         - Tool now determined in here (was in ToolConfiguration.tcl). 
#                            - Simplifies ActiveHDL startup
#                         - Initial tool settings now in VendorScripts_*.tcl (was in ToolConfiguration.tcl)              
#                         - Added: Default settings now in OsvvmScriptDefaults.tcl (was here)         
#                         - Removed: ToolConfiguration.tcl (now in StartUp.tcl and VendorScripts_*.tcl)                                
#     7/2020   2020.07    Refactored tool execution for simpler vendor customization
#     2/2020   2020.02    Moved tool determination to outer layer
#     1/2020   2020.01    Updated Licenses to Apache
#     2/2019   Beta       Project descriptors in .pro which execute 
#    11/2018   Alpha      Project descriptors in .files and .dirs files
#                         as TCL scripts in conjunction with the library 
#                         procedures
